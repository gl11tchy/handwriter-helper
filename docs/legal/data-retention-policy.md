# Data Retention Policy

## Scope
This policy covers signed assignment payloads and encrypted report artifacts stored by Handwriter Helper.

## Retention Duration
- Signed assignment payloads: retained for up to 30 days.
- Encrypted report artifacts: retained for up to 30 days.

## Deletion Process
- Routine deletion:
  - Stored artifacts should be removed after the 30-day retention window.
- Manual deletion requests:
  - Requests are handled manually via support at `support@writinglines.com`.
  - Include the assignment or report link when possible to speed up deletion lookup.

## Notes
- Reports are encrypted client-side before upload.
- In the standard flow, decryption keys remain in the URL fragment and are not sent with report upload.
- If assignment email notifications are enabled, the decryption key is included with report upload so emailed links can open the report.
